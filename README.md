# Bloxy: An Ad-Blocking Proxy

## Contributing

See the [Contributing.md](Contributing.md) for more information on how to
contribute to this project, and [code-of-conduct.md](code-of-conduct.md) for the
project's code of conduct.

## Current Status

Bloxy is currently in active development and doesn't work at all.

## Roadmap

Bloxy is currently very early in the development phase and the broader project
roadmap is ill-defined right now.  The long term goal is to provide a suite of
ad-blocking tools that work at the network level to allow for ad-blocking and
privacy enhancements in the browser as well as in applications (for example,
mobile apps).
